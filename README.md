# Walsh’s Juice Company Optimization

## Overview
This repository contains files related to the optimization of Walsh’s Juice Company’s supply chain. The objective of this project was to minimize transportation and processing costs while ensuring product demand fulfillment. The analysis was conducted using an **Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model**.

## Project Files
- **Case Study Document**: Provides an in-depth analysis of the problem, solution approach, key findings, and recommendations.
- **Excel File**: Contains data used in the optimization model and results.
- **PowerPoint Presentation**: Summarizes the project findings and recommendations.
- **Word Document**: Detailed case study documentation.

## Problem Statement
Walsh’s Juice Company sources raw grape juice from three vineyards and processes it at four plants to produce bottled juice, frozen concentrate, and jelly. Each plant has capacity constraints and varying processing costs. The challenge is to minimize transportation and processing expenses while meeting production requirements.

## Solution Approach
The project applies an **Integer Linear Programming (ILP) model** to determine the optimal transportation routes and production allocation, considering:
- Vineyard supply limitations.
- Plant capacity constraints.
- Fixed transportation costs per ton.
- Processing cost variations among plants.
- Demand requirements for each product.

## Key Findings
- Optimized solution reduced total costs to **$10,694,500**.
- Sensitivity analysis identified opportunities for further savings.
- The optimal production allocation shifted to plants with lower processing costs.

## Recommendations
1. **Negotiate Better Transportation Rates** – Reduce expenses by optimizing routes.
2. **Reallocate Production** – Shift production to plants with lower processing costs.
3. **Optimize Transportation Routes** – Improve logistics to minimize transportation costs.
4. **Adjust Plant Capacity** – Expand cost-efficient plants for better resource utilization.
